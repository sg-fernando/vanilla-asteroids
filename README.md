# 🚀 Asteroids game

Asteroids game built with HTML Canvas and JavaScript. [Play it on GitHub Pages.](https://sg-fernando.github.io/vanilla-asteroids/)

You control a small triangular ship that follows your mouse pointer around the screen.
Asteroids spawn randomly from the edges of the screen and drift across space.
Your ship automatically fires laser blasts periodically to destroy incoming asteroids.

Each asteroid destroyed increases your score, but colliding with one ends the game!

## 🕹️ Controls

| Action      | Control  |
| --------- | ------------- |
| Move Ship | Move your mouse |
| Fire Lasers | Automatic (every 1.2s) |

The ship moves faster the further away your mouse is.
